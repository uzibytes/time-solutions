# time-solutions by UziBytes (Ujjwal Raj)

This is my first project on github made using C++. This project is a type of Time Management System which consists of modules like:- 
  1. Displaying **Live Time**
  2. A user set **Timer**
  3. A **Stopwatch** and 
  4. A **World Clock**
integrated in one CPP program.

Hope so you will enjoy viewing this project and please share your valuable suggestions/edits which would help improve this project and you will also definitely learn something from this ðŸ˜„.
Yeah...Its a win-win case.

There are two folders one for windows and the other for linux(or mac); run only that file which is compatible with your machine.

I have designed this project in such a way that it works on all the OS (Windows/Linux/Mac).
  Bulding this on a Windows Machine was comparatively easy but I chose the tougher side and built for both...Yeah #equality #warrior
  
 **For Linux Users -**
  Don't forget to include the header _"conioLinux.h"_ (Released under Public Domain). This header should be present in the same folder where "time_linux.cpp" is run.   This basically adds fuctionality of "getch()" to mac/linux machines which by default you don't get like in windows.

There are different functions for different tasks as mentioned above.

A fuction kbhit() is also added to add a fuctionality of exiting infinte loop on keyboard hit/press.
  This is also given just for mac/linux while windows's users have the privilege of directly accessing this fuction simply by calling it.
  
I am currently working on the 4th part World Clock in this project, which will soon be added...

*Edit* :- Finally added the fuctionality of World Clock. Also added some colour for better UI.

Please don't forget to provide your valuable suggestions.

Thanking You all !!
